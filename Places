Purpose: Script queries the Google Places API and the Google Place Details API in order to write out 
the Name, location and Hours of Operation for all places in the search radius specified in the api query string
to a csv file.

Some problems: Google Places API only returns 20 resutls per call, have to use a page next token to get the next 20,
a total max of 60 places is the most you can get back.
Also you must specifiy the 'place type' in the query string, so you would have to run this process for all the 
different place types, there are alot of them.....

Otherwise it works great!
